    "- Now we consider nodes that aren't in the depot, or the set $\\mathcal{N} - \\mathcal{O} - \\mathcal{E}$. We need flow conservation, meaning for any vehicle that enters a node, it must eventually leave. In other words, what goes in, which is $\\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}^-(n)} z_{ka}$, must eventually come out, which is $\\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}^+(n)} z_{ka}$. These two must be equal, so the full constraint is: $\\forall k \\in \\mathcal{K}, \\ \\forall n \\in \\mathcal{N} - \\mathcal{O} - \\mathcal{E}, \\ \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}^-(n)} z_{ka} = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}^+(n)} z_{ka}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "To actualize this constraint, check that, for all arcs for which the second arc array index (incoming is equal to $n$) is $n$ the summation equals over all arcs for which the first arc array index (outgoing is equal to $n$) is $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no need to worry about whether an arc stays at the same place in time, because the equality is still maintained, so we don't need an exclusive check."
